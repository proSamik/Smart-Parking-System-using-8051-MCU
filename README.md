# Smart-Parking-System-using-8051-MCU
A hardware prototype which precisely measures vehicle dimensions and after inferring the type of vehicle, suggests optimal parking spots. The system was simulated on Proteus software, and a well-designed PCB was developed for robust and efficient parking area management.

## Prerequisites to run this-

1. Proteus should be installed
2. Load the required files in Proteus
3. CPP code is given, install it in the simulation
4. Convert the CPP code into HEX file and load it in the 8051 IC to run it
